**Stateful Widgets in Flutter**
=============================

Stateful widgets in Flutter are dynamic and can change their appearance in response to user interactions or data updates. They maintain a mutable state, allowing them to rebuild themselves when their state changes.

### Key Features

- **Mutable State**: Can change during the widget's lifecycle.
- **State Management**: Uses a separate `State` class to manage state.
- **Rebuild on State Change**: Automatically rebuilds when state changes using `setState()`.

### Use Cases

- **Forms**: Capturing user input and validating data.
- **Real-time Data**: Displaying data that updates dynamically.
- **Animations and Interactions**: Handling complex user interactions and animations.

### Examples of Stateful Widgets

1. **Checkbox**
2. **Radio**
3. **Slider**
4. **InkWell**
5. **Form**
6. **TextField**


### Best Practices

- Use stateful widgets for dynamic UI components.
- Manage state efficiently using `setState()` to avoid unnecessary rebuilds.
- Keep stateful widgets focused on handling dynamic data and user interactions.
