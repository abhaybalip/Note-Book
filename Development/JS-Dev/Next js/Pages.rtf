Next.js employs a file-system-based routing system, making it incredibly straightforward to manage navigation within your application.

Key Points:
Pages Directory: All pages reside within the pages directory of your project.

File-Based Routing: The file name directly correlates to the URL path.
pages/index.js maps to the root path (/).
pages/about.js maps to /about.

Dynamic Routes: Use square brackets for dynamic segments in file names.
pages/posts/[id].js allows for dynamic URLs like /posts/1, /posts/my-post.

Nested Routes: Create nested directories within pages for hierarchical routes.
pages/blog/index.js maps to /blog.
pages/blog/post/[id].js maps to /blog/post/:id.

Link Component: Use the Link component from next/link for internal navigation.
