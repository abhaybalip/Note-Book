**Here's a clear explanation of scope in AngularJS:**

**Scope is a fundamental concept in AngularJS that acts as the glue between the view (HTML) and the controller (JavaScript).** It's a JavaScript object that serves as a container for:

- **Application model:** It holds the data and properties that are shared between the view and the controller.
- **Execution context for expressions:** It's where AngularJS evaluates expressions within the view, such as `{{ myName }}` or `ng-bind="myAge"`.

**Key characteristics of scope:**

- **Hierarchical structure:** Scopes are nested, reflecting the DOM structure of the application.
- **Prototypical inheritance:** Child scopes inherit properties from their parent scopes, allowing for data sharing and communication.
- **Watch expressions:** Scopes provide a way to observe model changes and trigger actions when those changes occur.
- **Event propagation:** Events triggered within a scope can propagate up to its parent scopes.

**Types of scopes:**

1. **Root scope:** The topmost scope, created when the AngularJS application starts. It's accessible throughout the entire application.
2. **Controller scope:** A new scope is created for each controller, forming a child-parent relationship with the parent scope.
3. **Isolate scope:** A special scope created with directives like `ng-isolate-scope`. It doesn't inherit from its parent scope, promoting encapsulation and reusability.
