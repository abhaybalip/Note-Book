**In AngularJS, controllers serve as the glue between your application's data, logic, and views.** They are responsible for:

- **Managing data:** Handling data retrieval, manipulation, and communication with the view layer.
- **Implementing application logic:** Executing actions, responding to user events, and coordinating activities within the application.
- **Exposing data to the view:** Making data accessible to the view layer through the `$scope` object, enabling dynamic updates in the UI.

**Key concepts:**

- **JavaScript functions:** Controllers are essentially JavaScript constructor functions.
- **`$scope` object:** A crucial bridge between controllers and views, acting as a shared data model.
- **`ng-controller` directive:** Attached to HTML elements to associate a controller with a specific portion of the view.
- **Multiple controllers:** An application can have multiple controllers, each managing specific parts of the view.
- **Scope hierarchy:** Controllers create child scopes, inheriting properties from parent scopes.
- **Interaction with other components:** Controllers can interact with services, directives, and filters.

**While AngularJS is no longer actively maintained, understanding controllers is valuable for grasping fundamental concepts in AngularJS applications and exploring its legacy codebases.**
