## Definition of Plugins
A **plugin** in Gradle is essentially a collection of tasks and configuration settings that can be applied to a project.
These plugins can automate common tasks such as compiling code, running tests, and managing dependencies.
By applying a plugin, a project can gain new tasks, domain objects, and conventions that streamline the build process[1][2].

## Types of Plugins
Gradle supports several types of plugins:

1. **Core Plugins**: These are built into Gradle and provide basic functionality. Examples include the Java plugin, which adds tasks for compiling Java code and managing dependencies[4].

2. **Community Plugins**: These are developed by the Gradle community and can be found in the Gradle Plugin Portal. They offer additional features not included in the core plugins[4][5].

3. **Custom Plugins**: Developers can create their own plugins tailored to specific project needs. This allows for greater flexibility and customization in build processes[4][2].
