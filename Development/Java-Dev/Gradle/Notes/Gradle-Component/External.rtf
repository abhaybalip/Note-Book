## Note on `ext` in Gradle

### Overview

In Gradle, the `ext` property is a powerful feature that allows developers to define and manage **extra properties** within their build scripts. These properties can be used to store custom data, configurations, and settings that are not part of the standard Gradle model. The `ext` property enhances the flexibility and maintainability of Gradle builds by enabling developers to create dynamic configurations.

### Key Features of `ext`

1. **Extra Properties**: The `ext` property allows you to define key-value pairs that can be accessed throughout your build script. This is particularly useful for storing configuration values, version numbers, or any other data that may need to be reused.

2. **Flexible Syntax**: Extra properties can be defined using an `ext` block or through direct assignment, making it easy to organize and manage properties.

   ```groovy
   ext {
       myProperty = "value"
   }
   ```

3. **Access and Modification**: Once defined, extra properties can be accessed without the `ext` prefix, allowing for straightforward usage in tasks and other closures. Additionally, these properties can be modified at any point in the build script.

   ```groovy
   println "My Property: $myProperty" // Accessing
   myProperty = "newValue" // Modifying
   ```

4. **Scope**: Extra properties are accessible throughout the entire build script and can also be inherited by subprojects in multi-project builds. This makes it easy to share common configurations across different modules.

### Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example demonstrating how to use `ext` in a Gradle build script:

```groovy
// Defining extra properties
ext {
    appVersion = '1.0'
    appName = 'MyApplication'
}

// Task to print the properties
task printInfo {
    doLast {
        println "Application Name: $appName"
        println "Application Version: $appVersion"
    }
}

// Task to update the version
task updateVersion {
    doLast {
        appVersion = '2.0' // Updating the version
        println "Updated Application Version: $appVersion"
    }
}
```

### Benefits

- **Maintainability**: Using `ext` helps keep your build scripts organized and reduces duplication by centralizing configuration values.
- **Flexibility**: You can easily adjust configuration values without modifying multiple parts of your build script.
- **Dynamic Builds**: By leveraging extra properties, you can create more dynamic and responsive build processes that adapt based on project needs.
